# Contributing to Proxy Guard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Proxy Guard as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/meinder-a/proxy-guard/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
